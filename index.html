	<h2>What is this site?</h2>
	<p>In an the ever changing world of fantasy sports, there are few people that actually know what they are talking about when it comes to fantasy football.  I am here to throw my name into the ring as the most knowledgeble fantasy player there is. My goal is to compare 2 players from a certain position and tellyou who is more valuable.  Over the next few weeks I will be doing comparisons of:

	<ul>
		<li>Running Backs</li>
		<li>Wide Recievers</li>
		<li>Tight Ends</li>
		<li>Quaterbacks</li>
		<li>Kickers</li>
		<li>and Defenses</li>
	</ul>

<p>This is one of the hardest comaparisons that I can make this year.  Both RBs are in the <b><a href="top_3.html">top 3</a></b> this year, and with the exception of Mevlin Gordon putting up 9.5 points last night against Denver, neither of them have had a game end with less that 10 points.  THe only difference is that the Cardnials OL is orders of magnitude better than the Chargers's.  Which is why today I am going to say that David Johnson is the more valuable player of the two and to that affect, I would say he is the <i>best</i> RB in the NFL right now. With that said, Melvin Gordon is leading the entire NFL in touchdowns right now, so Keep an eye on him for the rest of the season.

<h3>Website Similar to Mine:</h3>
	<p><a href="http://www.espn.com">ESPN</a> is a great website for comparing fantasy football players.  I'm not sure how if I am to say if ESPN is good or bad for my index.html or if its refering to the elements I used.  But either way, ESPN uses a lot of <i>nav</i> and <i>div</i> tages to make everything format nicer and they use a <b>LOT</b> of tables to display information so I think my sit is on the right track!</p>
